# FavoriteManagerApp

FavoriteManagerApp is a simple iOS application built with **UIKit** that demonstrates how to work with table views, custom reusable cells, navigation controllers, and passing data between screens. The app displays a list of favorite items (movies, music, books, or courses). When the user taps on an item, the app navigates to a detailed screen showing an image, title, description, and review.
