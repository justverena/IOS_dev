Why I used a class for ShoppingCart

I used a class for the shopping cart because it should be the same object everywhere.
If I pass the cart to a function and add an item, I want the original cart to change too.
This works because classes use reference semantics.
It makes sense for a cart, since the user always has one current cart.

Why I used structs for Product and Order

I used structs for products and orders because they are simple data models.
A product or an order should not change once itâ€™s created.
Structs use value semantics, so they are copied instead of shared.
This keeps data safe and avoids unexpected changes.

Example of reference semantics

In the test, I call modifyCart(_:) and add a product inside it.
After the function ends, the main cart also has the new product.
This happens because both variables point to the same cart object.

Example of value semantics

I also tested copying a CartItem struct.
When I changed the quantity of the copy, the original did not change.
This shows that structs are stored by value, not by reference.

Challenges

I had small issues with optionals and mutating functions in structs.
I learned that reduce(into:) needs += to work correctly.
